# Cloud_cover

The final1_ notebook consists of code used to build a segmentation model to estimate cloud cover.

The final2_ notebook consists of code used to perform the following tasks:
1. Classification of image into night, clear, cloudy
2. Using previously build segmentation model on this dataset and comparing results
3. CNN regression model to estimate cloud cover directly from the sky image

The final3_ notebook consists of the Convolutional LSTM code used to predict future sky images.

The prelim files consists of code used to do preprocessing of images, experiments tried out, etc
